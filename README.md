LA data
=======

Scripts and notes for working with data in the City of Los Angeles, mostly for
596 Acres' [Living Lots LA](https://github.com/596acres/livinglots-la), but
potentially useful for others, too.

This data is mostly useful for understanding public and private vacant land in
Los Angeles.


Where's the data coming from?

Check the `Makefile` for the specifics. Where the data is coming from elsewhere,
